## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/PYTHON_DSA.git
    ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter Notebook
    ```
3. Navigate to the folder of the specific data structure or algorithm you'd like to explore and open the corresponding .ipynb file.

## Usage

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained, with explanations and examples that demonstrate the functionality of each data structure and algorithm. Modify the test cases in `test.ipynb` files to explore and understand each concept further.
